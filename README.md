Access Fabric 403

This project is a simulation engine. It does not implement real access control or infrastructure security. It is designed for experimental, conceptual and research-oriented purposes.

Access Fabric 403 is a policy-driven access control simulation engine that transforms a standard HTTP 403 response into a dynamic, state-based runtime experience.

It combines geo-weighted traffic modeling, session profiling, authorization logic and layered rendering into a deterministic yet randomized system. This is not a static error page. It is an execution fabric.

Access Fabric 403 models how access decisions are made, evaluated and rendered in a distributed environment.

Each runtime instance produces a consistent but unique execution trace.

The system is configuration-driven via config.txt.

No production infrastructure logic is included.
